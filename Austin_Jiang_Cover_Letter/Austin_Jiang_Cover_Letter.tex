Dear hiring manager,

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo applying for the Software Engineering Intern role. I am particularly passionate about performance, runtime systems, and machine learning infrastructure.

I am currently an undergraduate research assistant in the Multicore Lab at the UWaterloo, where I work on extending Verlib (PPoPP’24) with \textbf{lock-free GPU data structures} to support linearizable range queries at \textbf{10M-key scale}. My work focuses on \textbf{correctness and performance} under concurrency, including implementing \textbf{CPU baselines for controlled benchmarking} and debugging low-level GPU systems code.

Previously at Wolfram Research, I worked on a parallel cellular automata runtime, focusing on \textbf{execution design, load balancing, and benchmarking}. I built a parallel engine handling $\mathbf{10^{10}}$ cells across \textbf{8 CPU cores} and implemented sparse frontier updates and dense scans, achieving up to a \textbf{127\% speedup} on low-activity states.

My competitive programming background, including being \textbf{two-time Canadian Computing Olympiad Silver Medalist (national top 10)} and \textbf{USACO Platinum}, reflects my solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and systems fundamentals.

I am particularly interested in internships where correctness, reliability, and low-level understanding
matter, and I would love the opportunity to contribute to your team.

Sincerely,\\
Austin Jiang
